# MIT DeepTraffic Competition
My javascript code that I submitted for MIT's 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars competition (DeepTraffic).
I have uploaded two sets of code, one is pre-trained and one is after training.

I was able to achieve a best result of 75.03mph (average result was +- 0.3mph) and is currently at Rank 6 after training my AI for around 10hours.

# Neural Network Architecture
In this area, I experimented a few times with different architectures and decided to use a 4 layer neural network. I tried using Relu in my last hidden layer but decided that I needed tanh activation in my last hidden layer. Relu is also possible but it is just my personal preference.
