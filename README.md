# mitselfdrivingcars
My javascript code that I submitted for MIT's 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars competition (DeepTraffic).
I have uploaded two sets of code, one is pre-trained and one is after training.

I was able to achieve a best result of 74.86mph (average result was +- 0.2mph) after training my AI for around 10hours.
